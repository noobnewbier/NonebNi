From present me to future me.

This assembly consists of folder purely for developer testing, and should not make it to the final build by any means.

They are mostly meant to be throw away scripts that's only for demo purposes. If you want to make a "test" script that's going to help verify stuffs in the long run, put it somewhere else.
